# plotly-dashboard
This project uses a javascript backend to supply information to an interactive HTML dashboard. Plotly was used to generate the plots and D3 to dynamically write html to the page. The data presented in this dashboard comes from The Public Science Lab at North Carolina State University. It explores samples of bacteria taken from belly buttons.
